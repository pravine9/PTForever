This is your memory timeline. Add your shared memories here (you can do this after the birthday too!).

1. Find `index.html` in the project folder
2. Double-click it to open

**Try it out!** Click around, test the quiz, see how everything works.

## 💝 For Thuvaraha's Birthday

Since her birthday is coming up, here's your priority:

**This Week:**
1. Add the quiz questions → `data/quiz.json`
2. Write a sweet success message
3. Add any photos you have → `media/` folder
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

**After Birthday:**
- Keep adding memories over time
- Add more photos
- Create anniversary quizzes
- Build your forever timeline together

## 🆘 Need Help?

### "I'm stuck on something"
→ Check `SETUP.md` - it has solutions for common issues

### "What's this JSON error?"
→ Go to [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) and paste your code

### "The site won't deploy"
→ Check the troubleshooting section in `README.md`

### "I want to change the colors"
→ Look in `css/style.css` at the top (`:root` section)

## ✨ Pro Tips

1. **Test everything locally first** before deploying
2. **Use simple filenames** for photos (no spaces!)
3. **Commit to git often** so you can undo mistakes
4. **Start with fewer questions** and add more later
5. **The password default is "forever"** - change it in the JSON
