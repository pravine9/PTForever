I was so nervous - I think this is the most nervous I've ever been with you and I was lost for words. It was such short call but that moment I felt connected to you in a different way. I didn't know what to expect but I noticed you had a slight Sri Lankan accent. After the call you told me you were so nervous too and we laughed about how you had an accent and that no one ever said that about you, everyone said your English sounded so posh.",

    "content": "After a month of talking, we finally met in person. I was begging to see you even just for 5-10 minutes as I was so curious to put a face to the voice I had been talking to over the phone. I remember driving down to you from my house in Hemel Hempstead to see you whilst you were staying over at your uncle's house in Hounslow. I came in my silver Golf near the address you gave me, and I was a little nervous but excited to see you. I was driving down your road looking for you and messaging you to check where you were. I noticed a woman wearing black and I had a feeling that might be you, and cool, calm and collected opened my window and asked is that Thuvaraha. You were like yeah, so I parked up next to the kerb and opened the door from the inside and said jump in. The first time meeting you, I wanted to make this a special one so I got you white flowers to keep as a memory of us. The way we spoke everything felt so natural and easy. We were touching each others hands and i was caressing your knee, I never thought it would pan out this way. I even kissed you on the dorsum of you hand and your cheek even though I had embarrasingly asked you first. I didn't want to make you uncomfortable so I thought it would be courteous to ask first. We even took our first few photos of each other. Till this day from the moment I laid my eyes on you, I felt so at peace. I knew I had to make you mine.",

I told you I was alright and not great at bowling, but by the end you felt like I cheated you and downplayed my skills. I was lowkey gassed how I did and it was so much fun. This was also the first time you drank alcohol. I decided to get a vodka and lemonade to loosen up a bit and you took a sip from my cup. We went to arcade after and played a bunch of random games, I loved seeing you play. I was beating you at every game but I think you eventually beat me at something... Basketball. I really need to work on that. After everything, we got in the car and were just chilling and talking together. The conversation was flowing so naturally, and I felt so comfortable with you. I kept looking at you, I couldn't take my eyes off you. We shared our ever first kiss that day. Everything around us faded away, and in that moment, it was just us. Time stood still... it was perfect. I will never forget that day.",

We got out of the car and hugged each other so tight. I spent the whole journey home thinking about us and how much I was falling for you.",

Thankfully, I was working at Abbey's that day and it got super busy, plus I downloaded Whiteout Survival (yes, that game that's caused us so many petty arguments and laughs since then hehe). I even slept early to stop overthinking. When the challenge finally ended, I was so happy to hear from you again. It was worth it, but never again!",

In the days leading up to this, we had been getting closer and closer, getting to know each other on a deeper level, and it felt like everything was falling into place. Sitting there with you, it finally felt like the right time. It wasn't a grand gesture or a dramatic moment - just us together in the simplest of settings. The world around us faded away, and I looked at you and said those three words that had been building up inside me: \"I love you.\" It was a surreal moment, but I couldn't keep it in anymore. I knew way before how much you meant to me and how I felt about you. You mean everything to me, and I needed you to know.",

But there you were, looking at me with those beautiful eyes, and you said \"I love you.\" My heart exploded with happiness in that moment. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. All the thinking, all the waiting, it melted away instantly. Hearing you say 'I love you' was the best gift I could ever receive from you in that moment. It made everything real. You loved me back, and nothing else in the world mattered.",
